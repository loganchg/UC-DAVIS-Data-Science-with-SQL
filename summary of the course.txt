Congratulations. You've successfully completed this
course on SQL for data science. In this course, we went over
an extraordinary amount of material. We started simple by going
over standard SQL syntax, some standard databases terminology and how to write simple queries to help you
select data from tables and work with it. We moved on to discussing
methods to filter and sort your data results by using common
operators and clauses like where, like, order by, goodbye, and between. We also spent quite a bit of time
talking about subqueries and different kinds of JOINS. We learned how to use case statements in
order to help you categorize your data, and then we ended up going over some
specific strategies to keep in mind when you're using SQL for
data science purposes. Always remember,
slowly do when writing your queries. And I guarantee you that your queries
will be cleaner and more efficient. Between all the things you've learned and all the practice assignments you've
accomplished, you've come a long ways and learned an enormous amount of SQL and
how it's used for the data science field. You should be proud of
what you've accomplished. I hope that through this
course you've discovered just how powerful SQL can
be in data science, and learned a little bit about how fascinating
the data science field truly is. I hope that this is just the beginning
of your data science journey and you are inspired to do more. Remember, data is everywhere and
the more you know how to use it and use the data to gain insights and
make better decisions, the more value you'll be able to provide
to any organization you're a part of. Thanks so much for joining me. I hope you take these new skills you've
learned and do good to change the world. Best of luck. [MUSIC]
